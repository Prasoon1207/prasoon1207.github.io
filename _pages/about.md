Hi! Welcome to my webpage. <br><br>
I graduated from IIT-D on August 10, 2024, with a dual degree in Maths & Computing. I worked as a graduate researcher under <a href = 'https://tanmoychak.com/'>Prof. Tanmoy Chaktraborty</a> in the <a href = 'lcs2.in'>Laboratory for Computational Social Sciences</a>. My research interests primarily lie in explaining the behaviour of modern LLMs through mechanistic interpretation and establishing parallels between the biological think-tank 'brain' and modern architectures for language modelling. I am currently working as a quantitative model validator for counter-party credit risk models in derivative trading, at <a href = 'wellsfargo.com'>Wells Fargo</a>. The opportunity to re-learn math fundamentals there after months of making LLMs learn from context is surely refreshing. (But my heart still lies inside an MLP layer). <br>

Apart from coding and doing math, I rock-climb, cycle and do a little bit of sketching.<br>
I also follow Chelsea F.C. and am an active FPL player.<br>
Do message me at any of my contact points if you want to talk about NLP <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Tq-eAJIk4'>, Progressive Rock</a> or <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJQ_QvNGhHc'>The Big Bang Theory</a>.
