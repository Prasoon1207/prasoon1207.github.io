Hi! Welcome to my webpage. <br>
I graduated from IIT-D a few months ago. I worked as a graduate researcher under Prof. Tanmoy Chaktroborty in the Laboratory for Computational Social Sciences. My research interests primarily lie in explaining the behaviour of modern LLMs through mechanistic interpretation and establishing parallels between the biological think-tank the 'brain' and modern architectures for language modelling. I am currently working as a quantitative model validator for counter-party credit risk models in derivative trading at Wells Fargo. The opportunity to re-learn math fundamentals there after months of making LLMs learn from context is surely refreshing. (But my heart lies inside an MLP layer)
