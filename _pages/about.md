<a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdw'> Hello There </a> <br>

I graduated from IIT-D on August 10, 2024, with a dual degree in Maths & Computing. During my last two years there, I worked as a graduate researcher under <a href = 'https://tanmoychak.com/'>Prof. Tanmoy Chaktraborty</a> in the <a href = 'lcs2.in'>Laboratory for Computational Social Sciences</a>. 

My primary research interest is enhancing and understanding reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). I also intend to improve the current reasoning baselines by advancing research on multi-agent LLM frameworks. Since the human act of formal reasoning extends beyond the low-bandwidth medium of text, I want to test the utility of multimodal large language models as exhaustive reasoning engines, while providing explainability for their internal representations containing fused modalities. I am also interested in providing explainability for a broad spectrum of emergent LLM phenomena and enhancing the robustness of LLMs, under the dual perspective of being faithful to a provided source content and being aligned to a specific target domain. My lateral expectations for myself are to make user-friendly and openly accessible AI tools grounded on robust and safe reasoning frameworks.
