_When you walk through a storm..<br>
Hold your head up high...<br>
For at the end of the storm,<br>
There is a golden sky_<br>
<br>
I graduated from IIT-D on August 10, 2024, with a dual degree in Maths & Computing. There, I also worked as a graduate researcher under <a href = 'https://tanmoychak.com/'>Prof. Tanmoy Chaktraborty</a> in the <a href = 'lcs2.in'>Laboratory for Computational Social Sciences</a>. My research interests primarily lie in explaining the behaviour of modern LLMs through mechanistic interpretation and establishing parallels between the biological think-tank (squishy brain) and modern architectures for language modelling. I am currently working as a quantitative model researcher at <a href = 'wellsfargo.com'>Wells Fargo</a>. The opportunity to re-learn math fundamentals there after months of making LLMs learn from context is surely refreshing. (But my heart still lies inside a neural net). <br>

Apart from coding and doing math, I cycle and do a little bit of sketching.<br>
I also follow Chelsea F.C. and am an active FPL player (Team link to be added soon).<br>
Do message me at any of my contact points if you want to talk about NLP <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Tq-eAJIk4'>, Progressive Rock</a> or <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XIuBCFNBFw'>The Big Bang Theory</a>.
