<a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdw'> Hello There </a> <br>

I graduated from IIT-D on August 10, 2024, with a dual degree in Maths & Computing. During my last two years there, I worked as a graduate researcher under <a href = 'https://tanmoychak.com/'>Prof. Tanmoy Chaktraborty</a> in the <a href = 'lcs2.in'>Laboratory for Computational Social Sciences</a>. 

My primary research interest is enhancing and understanding reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). I also intend to improve the current reasoning baselines by advancing research on multi-agent LLM frameworks. Since the human act of formal reasoning extends beyond the low-bandwidth medium of text, I want to test the utility of multimodal large language models as exhaustive reasoning engines, while providing explainability for their internal representations containing fused modalities. I am also interested in providing explainability for a broad spectrum of emergent LLM phenomena and enhancing the robustness of LLMs, under the dual perspective of being faithful to a provided source content and being aligned to a specific target domain. My lateral expectations for myself are to make user-friendly and openly accessible AI tools grounded on robust and safe reasoning frameworks.

A set of my future research interests:

- **Dense representation of ‘Thoughts’**: ‘Thoughts’ are latent mental representations which are utilized for reasoning and knowledge retrieval. Within natural language modelling, ‘thought’ is defined as a ‘coherent sequence of intermediary reasoning texts’ produced as a response to a reasoning query[12]. The bandwidth of language as a medium of channelling information is low. The representation of thoughts in text limits the range of conveyed information, although it provides the benefit of interpretability and downstream recycling for a conversational framework. There is a scope to model ‘thoughts’ using a dynamic vector data structure which not only provides a high-bandwidth medium but also allows for a more well-defined evaluation of the formal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. 


- **Multimodal LLMs for Reasoning**: Humans, or rather almost all living things, learn and adapt in a multimodal environment. Moreover, the growing application of robotics requires an increased focus on enhancing reasoning through multimodal information. Creating efficient and robust reasoning frameworks grounded on multimodal LLMs is a highly motivating direction of research with guaranteed industry usage.

- **Community of LLM-based agents**: - Humans formed communities for exchanging information and receiving critical feedback, which accelerated the intellectual evolution of humanity. Motivated by this, I want to enhance formal reasoning capabilities by using a community of LLM-based agents. Task description and orchestration of complex arguments within this society of LLM-based agents is a research track advancing upon which is highly motivating for me.

My research interests primarily lie in explaining the behaviour of modern LLMs through mechanistic interpretation and establishing parallels between the biological think-tank (yes, the _squishy brain_) and modern architectures for language modelling. I am working on some cool problems as a quantitative model researcher at <a href = 'wellsfargo.com'>Wells Fargo</a>. The opportunity to re-learn <a href = 'https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~lawler/finbook.pdf'> math </a> fundamentals is surely refreshing. (But my heart still lies inside a neural net). <br>
