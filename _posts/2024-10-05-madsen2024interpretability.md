I often consider myself lucky (and blessed) to have gotten to approach computational language modelling and its subsidiaries after taking all relevant linguisitcs courses offered by the Humanities Department at IIT Delhi. I remember myself getting deeply intrigued about the impact of language understanding in shaping the intellect of new-born babies and how human intelligence (which manifests to intelligence and theorems) got accelerated by collaboration enabled using complex language symbols. When I met people who explained to me first, the task of **next word prediction** using deep learning, I found myself comfortably positioned to harness my knowledge and deep internal ambition to **modelling human intelligence**. This blog is just the projection of my initial thoughts on this idea and I have gathered the required confidence to translate my ambition to a workable project after going through papers listed in the _References_ subsection below.
